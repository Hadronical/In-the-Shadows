# In the Shadows

A 2D, top-down "tactical" stealth shooter.

### Details
Developed in JavaScript using the p5.js clientside library for graphics. A custom – though crude – rendering and "game engine" was written for for the game itself. This project was a prototype mainly focused on further developing and creating a custom deferred renderer for shadows, lighting, and some basic post processing.

*The game is in development, though progress will be slow due to other commitments.*
